# Final Project

Your final project is an opportunity to explore a topic of your choice in depth, using the tools and methods we've explored in class. You will be expected to develop a research question, propose a spatial analytic methodology, collect and analyze data, and present your findings in a final presentation. Your final presentation should be about 10 minutes, and should include a brief overview of your research question, methodology, and findings. The final deliverable will be a Github Pages site that includes your presentation and the notebook(s) you used to conduct your analysis.

We will check in regularly on your progress, and you will have to get sign off on your research question, and methodology, before you can proceed with your analysis.

## Project Components
### Research Question
The guiding question for your research should be a question that can be answered using spatial data and analysis. It should be a question that is of interest to you, and that you can answer using the data and tools available to you. Your research question should be specific, and should be something that you can answer in the time available to you. Of course, many of the most interesting research questions are larger than you could reasonably answer over the course of our class- it is reasonable to acknowledge this, and discuss how you would expand your research in the future.

### Proposed Methodology
Your methodology should clearly lay out the inputs, processes, and outputs that you expect to use in your analysis. You should clearly articulate the transformations that you will apply to your data, the packages and algorithms used to manipulate and combine data sources, and the attributes that you will use to calculate and evaluate your results. The methodology will continue to take shape over the course of the project, but you should be able to demonstrate conceptually what you plan to do. I will accept either a written description or a flowchart of your methodology, as long as you can explain it clearly.


### Data Sources
You should present your data sources with full citations. Note that you should only include data **that you have in hand**, not data that you think you can acquire. I am happy to advise on data acquisition, but that is not the main focus of this class or this project.

### Analysis
All code should be included in a Jupyter notebook, and should be well-commented and organized. Different phases of your analysis should be clearly separated, and I should be able to run your code from start to finish without errors and produce the same results. 

### Visualization
Use static and/or interactive maps, charts, and tables to express your findings.

### Presentation
Use these sections as a starting point to organize your materials in order to make a compelling and engaging narrative presentation. Final presentations should be roughly seven minutes long, with a few minutes for questions.
