# Loading and visualizing data
Load and visualize a dataset of interest, either from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or elsewhere. (If you already have an idea of what your final project topic will be, this would be a good opportunity to get a head start on that). 

Explore its metadata and attributes, and hone in on one or two attributes in particular of interest. Provide explanation (numeric, graphical, textual) of what the attribute can and cannot tell us. Save the dataset out to the file format of your choice (but know why you chose that format).
