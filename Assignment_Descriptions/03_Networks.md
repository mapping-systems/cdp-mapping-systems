# Networks

Define a network, and calculate the distance between different elements of it. Discuss the experiential differences between Euclidean and network distance for the objects in question. Bonus points (in the form of kudos) for quantitative exploration of the network as described in Xin et al. (2022).

Provide a notebook with the research statement clearly stated, and step through the creation of the network; the nodes for which you are measuring distance; and your reflection on the results. You should produce a series of maps and charts to show your work.
