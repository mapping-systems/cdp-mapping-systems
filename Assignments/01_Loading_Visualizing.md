# 01. Loading and visualizing data

Load and visualize a dataset of interest, either from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) or elsewhere. (If you already have an idea of what your final colloquium project topic will be, this would be a good opportunity to get a head start on that).

Explore its metadata and attributes, and hone in on one or two attributes in particular of interest. In a notebook, make map and non-map visualizations that explore these attributes. Provide in-line notes that describe your thought process in choosing which attributes to visualize, and what they mean. Provide explanation (numeric, graphical, textual) of what the attribute can and cannot tell us.

If you feel so inclined, you can publish your analysis as a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) app. If you do, please include a link to it in your notebook.
