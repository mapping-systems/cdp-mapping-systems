# Mapping Systems

## Introduction

*Mapping Systems* will introduce CDP students to programming concepts and methods for spatial analysis, as well as their role in the production and interpretation of spatial data. 

The course will focus on building proficiency in Python-based workflows focused on finding, describing, and visualizing spatial data; manipulating and drawing meaning from data layers; understanding distance and spatial relatedness; and measuring change over time. While a primary goal of this course is to introduce students to practical tools and workflows and build fluency in their use, the course will also introduce students to some historical and conceptual context, as well as case studies. 

The course will require students to complete exercises to gain proficiency in spatial analytic tools, and will culminate in a final project investigating a spatial research question.

## Learning Objectives

##  Course Organization / Communication

Class meets on Tuesdays and Thursday at **xx** from 6-8pm. Weeks will generally be organized as follows:
**Tuesday**: Lecture, reading discussion, review of technical concepts
**Thursday**: Tutorials, desk crits for exercises and final project

Conversation topics that pertain to the entire class, such as meeting time/location or technical difficulties / troubleshooting can live in the course Discord thread. All other questions can be sent to me directly via email at mag2382@columbia.edu.

All slides and tutorials will be posted to the course's [Github repository](https://github.com/mapping-systems/cdp-mapping-systems). All exercises, as well as final project progress, will be saved and managed in Github as well (details below).

## Office Hours 

Office hours are by appointment, and preferable on Tuesday or Thursdays before or after class. Email me to schedule a time to chat.
## Final Project

*Details to come* 
*Add schedule of final project here as well as below*


## Schedule

### Week 01
Getting started
#### Class 01: Introductions
- Introductions, review of syllabus
- Orientation to course Github
- A brief history of GIS + computer mapping
- Projections
- Vector data types

	**Exercise**: Install VSCode, create Python environment, join course Github (details tbd)

	**Readings**: [tk]

#### Class 02: Loading, exploring, visualizing data (Tutorial)
- Explore spatial and non-spatial attributes of tax lot dataset
- Create static and interactive visualizations of dataset
- Saving data
	**Exercise:** tk, but something like loading and choosing an attribute of a dataset of their choice, explaining what the attribute can and cannot tell us, mapping it, saving it out to a FGB or another format
	
### Week 02
Geoprocessing / vector data analysis basics using `pyogrio`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `lonboard
#### Class 03: The power of mapping
- Mapping as creative process, critical practice, and counter-narrative
- Case study: Environmental Justice in New York City and New York State

	**Exercise:** tk
	**Readings**: tk

#### Class 04: Geoprocessing (Tutorial)
- Manipulate, reshape, and combine datasets together using spatial and non-spatial characteristics using `geopandas` and `shapely`
	**Final Project Deliverable**: Research question and draft data manifest due


### Week 03

Ways to think about and measure distance and spatial relatedness 
#### Class 05: Distance, Adjacency, Networks
- Euclidean and network distance
- Introduction to graph theory
- Different kinds of adjacency
- Case study: CitiBike usage before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
	**Exercise:** tk
	**Readings**: tk, Barabasi, the Citibike example paper
#### Class 06: Measuring Distance (Tutorial)
- Introduce `osmnx`, `networkx`, `libpysal`, `h3` to calculate distance from Avery to local points of interest
- **Desk crits** on final projects

	**Final Project Deliverable:** Conceptual methodology due

### Week 04

Raster analysis, STAC specification, change over time
#### Class 07: Measuring Change
- Introduction to raster data
- Historical context for measuring change over time
- Case study: National Land Cover Dataset
- **Desk Crits** + checking in

##### Readings


#### Class 08: Supervised classification using earth observation (EO) data
- Use `geemap`, `rasterio`, `ipyleaflet` to find, download, classify, and analyze raster data
- **Desk crits** 

### Week 05

Wrapping up + the things we didn't get to
#### Class 09: Looking forward
- Implications for practice
- Connections to other kinds of computational design practices
